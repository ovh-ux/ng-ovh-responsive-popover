> `responsive-popover` module is used to display a popover and adapt it to the screen dimension.

The two major directives are:
- the `responsivePopover` directive that will display a uibPopover to the DOM element you instanciate it;
- the `responsivePopoverClass` directive that is added to the popover popup.

**Note:** when ui-bootstrap will be updated to version >= 2.0, it should be possible to remove `responsivePopover` directive and use uibPopover directive with custom class responsive-popover-class. So `responsivePopoverClass` directive will be the only directive of this component.

### <a name="responsivePopover_directive_responsivePopover"></a>`responsivePopover` - directive

For available options, see the doc of [uibPopover](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/popover).

#### Example

The following example will open a popover with the content of path/of/popover/content.html file inside. This popover will be closed when focus is lost inside of it.

```html
<button type="button"
        data-responsive-popover="'path/of/popover/content.html'"
        data-popover-placement="bottom-left"
        data-popover-trigger="focus">
</button>
```

This directive manage the way the popover is displayed. This uses the configuration setted into the `responsivePopoverProvider` to detect if the popover needs to be displayed on full screen or to be displayed normally.

**Note:** when ui-bootstrap version >= 2.0 will be used, the only thing to do should be to add a custom class with the 'popover-class' option of the uibPopover directive. To be tested.
